# Stanko Metodiev dotfiles and scripts collection
This is a combination of some bash scripts, automated tools, dotfiles and the like.

Below you'll find some files and folders and I'll be updating the structure and the formatting of the Git repository and try to improve it constantly.

My main goal of the Git repository here is to share some useful snippets I'm using on a daily basis. Feel free to re-use, modify and share them.

Feedback is always welcome, so feel free to share your thoughts
