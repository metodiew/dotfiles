# Stanko Metodiev dotfiles and my Toolbox
This is my collection of dotfiles, scripts, useful commands and scripts. The repository contains a combination of some bash scripts, automated tools, dotfiles and the like.

Here you can find plenty of different single files, folders, collections and the like and it's something I'm using on a daily basis. If you find some of these useful, feel free to re-use, modify and share them.

There is a folder *Toolbox* where you can find snippets, automated scripts and some tips and tricks.

Feedback is always welcome, so feel free to share your thoughts.
